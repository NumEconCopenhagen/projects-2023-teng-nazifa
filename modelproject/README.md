# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Cournot Equilibrium** and is about the micro economic interpretition on different type of market situation(Oligopaly,Duopoly and Monopoly).

The Cournot model explains how firms interact strategically by determining the output quantities. In this model, firms choose their output simultaneously while considering the output of their competitors, and the market price is established by the sum of the outputs of all firms. In an industry with three identical firms, we used this model to determine the Cournot equilibrium quantities and price. We also looked at how mergers affected the sector and discovered that they might have both good and bad effects on consumer welfare and competition.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [model_project.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
