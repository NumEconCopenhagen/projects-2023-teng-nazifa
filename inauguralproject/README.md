# Inaugural project

This assignment involves solving and analyzing a household production model which incorporates time use data of couples. The model assumes that the household derives disutility from time spent working, and aims to maximize the household's utility subject to various constraints. 

First, we illustrate how the ratio of female to male household production time changes with varying values of α and σ. Then we plot the logarithm of this ratio against the logarithm of the ratio of female to male wages for a range of different wage ratios. Next, we repeat the logarithmic plot analysis when the choice set is continuous, choose values of α and σ, which minimize the difference between estimated and actual coefficients of the regression of the logarithm of wF/wM household production time on the logarithm of the ratio of wF/wM.

Finally, we made an extension of the model to account for the assumption that men and women are equally productive in home production when α = 0.5, and to analyze whether this extension can help match the data.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
